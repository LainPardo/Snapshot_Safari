This is a sample script using a snapshot report from Mountain Zebra. In order to use this script for other sites, you have to adapt certain names in the arguments, but specially in the outputs (e.g. csv tables, figures, etc). Try to understand the main functions available here and in the Snapshot_source_function script.

Please give  credit to Lain E. Pardo, Snapshot Safari or WildEco Lab at Nelson Mandela University. We are open to collaborations.

This is a work in progress if you want to contribute or find any issues please let us know.

This report summarizes the basic mammalian diversity information for Mountain Zebra National Park based on the [Snapshot Safari project](https://www.zooniverse.org/organizations/meredithspalmer/snapshot-safari).  This is a large-scale international camera trap network to study and monitor the diversity and 
ecological dynamics of southern and eastern African mammals (see [Pardo et al 2021](https://sajs.co.za/article/view/8134)).

The project is coordinated in South Africa by Nelson by Mandela University’s Wildlife Ecology Lab. The images collected by the CTs (as much as thousands per site) are sent to the United States (University of Minnesota) to be processed via a citizen science platform (Zooniverse) and machine learning (a popular IT field that allows automatized recognition of elements in an image).

There might be some things more to check in the values or strings of some columns. Although in function clean_table we deal with a lot of this SNAPSHOT_source_functions.You might want to double check generic terms such as "zebra" or "antelope" and change accordingly


### 2_ Clean table 

Here we standardize species names, filter out no animals (e.g. fire), arrange some cols, force some strings to useful values, etc. There are two arguments here, you can include by_catch data by adding FALSE to rm_bycatch (birds etc, see formulation in the source functions to know what criteria was used) , and you can also put only presence absence

note: if you are sure about the starting date, then don´t use "min(photo.date)as start date, use "Setup.Date" from cameras filter by site (e.g.MTZ_Cams); 
use function "survey_period2", then manually add start date en mutate for subtraction to cam days, for example:

#surv_lengh <- surv_lengh %>% mutate(

### RAI alt of threatened species (VU, EN, CR) as per IUCN classification

```{r, include = FALSE, fig.cap="Fig.9.Scatter plot of species capture frequencies (standardize by effort"}
fig_RAI_spp(df.IUCN, species = "zebramountain") #
# species is the snapshot name here
```

<div
## Individual RAI plot  
##  Plot several species based on IUCN cat  


for this use the traits doc
need two files: 1) scientific names and other info like IUCN cat:
traits <- read_csv("data_in/traits_spp_scientif_names_snapshot_names.csv")
 and 2. file with RAIalt (created above)
function to apply for each spp is fig_RAI_spp
This will automatically create a file (jpg) for each threatened species without need of doing it one by one (saved in figures)
<>
</div>

```{r}
#  Loop across multiple species and store all graphs in a list

unique_names <- unique(df.IUCN$Common.Name)
grlist <- lapply(unique_names, 
                 function(spp) fig_RAI_spp(df.IUCN, species = spp))

grlist
# Name list to access each species easier

# Change it to unique_names
names(grlist) <- unique_names

#unique(grlist)

# ---- Plot just one graph by hand
#grlist[[1]]
#grlist$rabbitriverine  # Now works


# ---- Save each graph in a separate file in the current working directory
names <- names(grlist) # Plot all graphs

for(s in names){
  g <- grlist[[eval(s)]] # double brackets and store in object g
  
  ggsave(filename = paste0("figures/MTZ_RAIalt_",s, ".jpg"), g) # draw object g #not reading the folder, capy from wd
}

#check main folder and copy
